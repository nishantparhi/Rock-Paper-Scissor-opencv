# Rock Paper & Scissor using Open-CV

Everyone, once in their life, has played the game Rock, paper, and scissor. As I have less  friends to play with, I made this program which never gets bored playing with you. 

Jokes apart, this uses Computer Vision to recognize hand patterns and guess the move of the player and then throws a random move. This does not predict the user's pattern of playing to win. If you loose then its because of pure probability. 

To run the script, you need to install `opencv` and `numpy` to run the game.
	
    $ python main.py
 
Its better if you calibrate the game by pressing `c` and after calibration is done you can press `e` to start the game.
